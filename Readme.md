# myTODO

A full-stack task management application built with React.js and Node.js, featuring user authentication and a modern, responsive interface.


## üìù DESCRIPTION

myTODO is a comprehensive task management platform designed to help users organize and track their daily activities efficiently. The application provides a seamless experience for creating, editing, completing, and deleting tasks while maintaining user data security through robust authentication mechanisms. Built with modern web technologies, myTODO offers a clean interface with real-time updates and responsive design for optimal user experience across all devices.

## üõ† TECHNOLOGY STACK

myTODO leverages a modern full-stack architecture with the following technologies:

### FRONTEND

- **REACT.JS :**
  React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building dynamic user interfaces. The application utilizes React's component-based architecture to create reusable UI elements and manage application state effectively, ensuring smooth user interactions and optimal rendering performance.

- **VITE :**
  Vite serves as the build tool and development server, providing lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds. This modern bundler significantly improves development workflow and application performance.

- **TAILWIND CSS :**
  Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development with consistent design patterns. The framework provides responsive design capabilities and ensures a clean, modern aesthetic throughout the application.

- **REACT ROUTER DOM :**
  React Router Dom handles client-side routing, enabling seamless navigation between different pages and components without full page reloads, creating a smooth single-page application experience.

- **AXIOS :**
  Axios serves as the HTTP client for making API requests to the backend server. It provides interceptors, request/response transformation, and error handling capabilities for robust client-server communication.

- **REACT TOASTIFY :**
  React Toastify delivers elegant notification messages for user feedback, providing instant visual confirmation for user actions like creating, updating, or deleting tasks.

### BACKEND

- **NODE.JS :**
  Node.js powers the server-side runtime environment, enabling JavaScript execution outside the browser. It provides the foundation for building scalable backend services with excellent performance and concurrent request handling.

- **EXPRESS.JS :**
  Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that simplifies API development. It handles routing, middleware implementation, and HTTP request/response management efficiently.

- **MONGODB :**
  MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database solution, providing flexible document-based data storage. Its schema-less structure allows for easy adaptation to changing data requirements while maintaining high performance and scalability.

- **MONGOOSE :**
  Mongoose is an Object Document Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides schema validation, type casting, query building, and business logic hooks, making database operations more intuitive and secure.

- **JWT (JSON WEB TOKENS) :**
  JSON Web Tokens handle user authentication and authorization securely. JWTs enable stateless authentication, allowing users to access protected routes while maintaining session security.

- **BCRYPT :**
  Bcrypt provides secure password hashing functionality, ensuring user credentials are stored safely in the database with industry-standard encryption algorithms.

- **NODEMAILER :**
  Nodemailer facilitates email communication for features like account verification and password reset functionality, supporting various email service providers.

## üèó ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

The application follows a modern client-server architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
Frontend (React) ‚Üê‚Üí API Layer (Express) ‚Üê‚Üí Database (MongoDB)
```

The frontend communicates with the backend through RESTful API endpoints, while the backend manages data persistence and business logic.
